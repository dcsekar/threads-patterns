Need full Maven-based Java 25 project with the following thread concurrency submodules the current Java spring boot project


Project Modules:
Module 					Description
countdown-latch  		Batch job coordination (e.g., wait for 5 tasks)

exchanger  				Trade exchange between two threads
threadlocal  			Per-thread logging context
reentrantlock  			Shared resource with fairness toggle
blockingqueue  			Producer-consumer file writer
forkjoinpool  			Any real time example
completablefuture  		Async API call chain with error handlingEach


Each module should include:
	Clear logging with thread names Step-by-step explanations in code
	Provide Unit test to simulate behavior

Create the thread tasks as separate class - dont create in anonymous callable or supplier. Need clear class separations with real time examples.

Provide readme-thread-patterns file for comparisons of these models about usage, advantage, disadvantages.
Also provide visuals about each thread sub models topics
